# MSP430-Assembly-Codes-Microcomputer-Lab
This repository contains Assembly codes from my Microcomputer Lab course BLG 351E in ITU, focusing on the MSP430 microcontroller. It includes implementations of interrupts, timing mechanisms, and other low-level operations, structured across six weeks with multiple assignment solutions per week.
